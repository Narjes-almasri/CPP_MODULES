# CPP_MODULES
CPP Modules are C++ projects focused on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Through them, we learn about namespaces, classes, standard I/O streams, error handling, the Standard Template Library (STL), memory management, and safe type casting. 

## CPP00  
In this module, we learned how to create and use classes, work with namespaces correctly, use streams, and handle errors properly in C++.

## CPP01
In this module, we learned how to perform memory allocation in C++ using new and delete. We also learned about the difference between pointers and references, and how to create pointers to member functions.

## CPP02
In this module, we learned about creating classes in the orthodox canonical style, the use of fixed data types for memory optimization on older computers, ad-hoc polymorphism, and method overloading.

## CPP03
In this module, we learned about inheritance by creating derived classes that inherit members of a base class.

## CPP04
In this module, we learned about subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, and interfaces (pure abstract classes).
