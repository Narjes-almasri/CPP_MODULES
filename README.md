# CPP_MODULES
CPP Modules are C++ projects focused on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Through them, we learn about namespaces, classes, standard I/O streams, error handling, the Standard Template Library (STL), memory management, and safe type casting. 

## CPP00  
In this module, we learned how to create and use classes, work with namespaces correctly, use streams, and handle errors properly in C++.
